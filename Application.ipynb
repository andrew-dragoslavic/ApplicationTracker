The subject line is \"Countdown to Your Coding Success: Limited-Time Savings!\" and the body is a promotional announcement about Tim Buchalka's courses on Udemy.\n","\n","The email mentions a countdown to a coding success, offers limited-time savings on programming courses, and is directed towards Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy. It includes links to various courses and encourages the reader to take action before the discount expires.\n","\n","Given that the email is about promoting Udemy courses and is directed towards Tim Buchalka, who is an instructor at Learn Programming Academy, it appears to be a promotional email from the company itself. The content is clearly intended to sell courses and does not seem to be a response to a job application.\n","\n","Additionally, the email does not mention any job positions, the company is not seeking to fill a specific role, and the email is not seeking to discuss employment opportunities. Instead, it is focused on selling existing courses and promoting a special offer.\n","\n","Therefore, this email is not a job application response.

The company mentioned in the email is SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation, and the position is Software Engineer. The status options are received, interviewing, rejected, or job offer.\n","\n","First, I should check if the email is indeed a response to my job application. The subject says \"SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation is hiring: Software Engineer,\" which suggests it's about a job opening. The body starts with a greeting to Andrew, which I assume is me, since the sender is Joinrs. It mentions that they've written a personalized email based on my preferences and the job requirements. It talks about my Computer Engineering background and skills in C++, Java, and Python, which align with the job's requirements. It also mentions that the position offers onsite work, which I might have preferred.\n","\n","The email includes a link to the job posting on Joinrs, which is the platform I used to apply. It also has a P.S. advising me to disable the Joinrs AI button to read the full description. This seems like a direct follow-up to my application, as they're inviting me to apply to the position I applied for.\n","\n","Since the email is directly inviting me to apply to the position I applied for, it's likely a response to my job application. The status should be'received' because it's acknowledging my application and providing further details about the position.\n","\n","I don't see any signs of rejection or offer, so it's not'rejected' or 'job offer.' It's more of an acknowledgment and invitation to apply, so the status is'received.' The company is SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation, and the position is Software Engineer.\n","\n","So, putting it all together, the response should be in the format specified, listing the company, position, and status.\n","</think>\n","\n","Company: SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation, Job Position: Software Engineer, Status: received\n","Extracted Output: Company: SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation, Job Position: Software Engineer, Status: received\n","Extracted Data (this email): {'Company': 'SNC Sierra Nevada Corporation', 'Job Position': 'Software Engineer', 'Status': 'received'}\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Email 4:\n","Sender: Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com>\n","Subject: Security alert\n","Body: [image: Google] App password created to sign in to your account andrew.dragoslavic@gmail.com If you didn't generate this password for gmail, someone might be using your account.

The footer mentions Google's policies and contact info.\n","\n","So, the subject is \"Security alert,\" which doesn't sound like a job offer. The body talks about account security, which is a common email from companies about password changes or security issues. It's directed to a specific user's email and includes links. The sender is Google, which is a well-known company, but the email is about security, not a job application.\n","\n","Since the email is from Google about account security, it's not a job offer.

<cathysteve@aol.com> Rockland County Office for the Aging Good morning, Mary Ellen Distefano I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in potential employment opportunities with the Rockland County Office for the Aging. While I am aware that there are no current job postings, I am passionate about supporting the aging population and deeply admire the invaluable services your organization provides to seniors in Rockland County. It would be an honor to contribute to your work and help advance your mission of enhancing the quality of life for older adults in the community. With extensive experience working with the aging population, I have gained a thorough understanding of the unique challenges older adults face, particularly in communities. My work in providing services to both caregivers and care recipients has allowed me to develop key skills in advocacy, program development, direct care, and counseling, all of which I believe would be beneficial to your organization. I am particularly drawn to the Rockland County Office for the Aging’s commitment to promoting senior independence, improving healthcare access, and fostering social engagement opportunities. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to these important initiatives and utilizing my skills to help achieve your goals. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background and experience could contribute to the continued success of the Office for the Aging. I have attached my resume for your review and would be happy to provide any additional information if needed. Please feel free to contact me at (201) 694-1974 or via email at csmithward21@gmail.com to arrange a conversation. Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the well-being of seniors in Rockland County. Sincerely, Catherine Smithward\n","Full Response: Okay, so I need to analyze this email to determine if it's a response to a job application I sent to the specified company. The company mentioned in the email is Rockland County Office for the Aging, and the job position is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be related to their services.\n","\n","First, I'll check the sender's email. It's from C S at csmithward21@gmail.com. The subject is \"Fwd: test,\" which is a bit vague. The body starts with a forwarded message, so it's likely a copy-pasted email from somewhere else.\n","\n","The email is addressed to Mary Ellen Distefano at <cathysteve@aol.com>. The sender is introducing themselves as Catherine Smithward and expressing interest in potential employment opportunities with the Rockland County Office for the Aging. They mention their passion for supporting the aging population and their experience working with seniors. They also attach their resume and provide contact information.\n","\n","Now, I need to determine if this is a response to a job application. The company is Rockland County Office for the Aging, and the email is expressing interest in employment. However, the email is forwarded from the same sender, so it's possible that this is a follow-up to an earlier email they sent, or it's a copy-pasted message from another source.\n","\n","The subject line is \"Fwd: test,\" which suggests it's a forwarded message. The body is a forward of the same message, so it's likely that the original email was sent to someone else, and this is being forwarded to Mary Ellen. Therefore, this email is not a direct response to a job application sent to the specified company because it's a forwarded message, not a new application.\n","\n","Additionally, the email does not specify a job position, so it's unclear what specific role Catherine is applying for. The focus is more on her general interest in the organization rather than applying for a specific position.\n","\n","Moreover, the email is being sent to a specific individual, Mary Ellen Distefano, rather than the company's HR or a designated job application contact. This further indicates that it's not a formal job application response.\n","\n","Lastly, the email does not include any application materials or detailed information about the role, which are typically required in a job application response. It's more of a general expression of interest.\n","\n","Therefore, this email is not a proper response to a job application to the Rockland County Office for the Aging. It's a forwarded message and doesn't meet the criteria for a job application response.\n","</think>\n","\n","Not a job application email\n","Extracted Output: Not a job application email\n","Extracted Data (this email): None\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Email 7:\n","Sender: LinkedIn News <editors-noreply@linkedin.com>\n","Subject: 15 skills companies want right now\n","Body: ---------------------------------------- This email was intended for Andrew Dragoslavic (Computer Engineering Student at Albert Dorman Honors College) Learn why we included this: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/4788?lang=en&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Aemail_email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01%3BF%2BCP1kDPTHKzI%2BQsRXyDeA%3D%3D&midToken=AQEagltKN1Gz4Q&midSig=1RkDFRAHm49bI1&trk=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-SecurityHelp-0-textfooterglimmer&trkEmail=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-SecurityHelp-0-textfooterglimmer-null-fkhvzv~m8hvo4qk~5g-null-null&eid=fkhvzv-m8hvo4qk-5g&otpToken=MWIwMTFmZTQxMzI3Y2NjM2JkMjQwNGVkNDIxY2UyYjQ4OGM5ZDg0MTljYWY4YzYxNzljMjAwNjk0YzU5NWFmYWZmZDRkZjgzNTJlYWNjZDgwZWIzYTkwY2ZhOGY2OTA1YWE2NTllNDUxMWY4Y2JjYzg1M2Y4MSwxLDE%3D You are receiving Suggested Top Conversations emails Unsubscribe: https://www.linkedin.com/comm/psettings/email-unsubscribe?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Aemail_email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01%3BF%2BCP1kDPTHKzI%2BQsRXyDeA%3D%3D&midToken=AQEagltKN1Gz4Q&midSig=1RkDFRAHm49bI1&trk=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-unsubscribe-0-textfooterglimmer&trkEmail=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-unsubscribe-0-textfooterglimmer-null-fkhvzv~m8hvo4qk~5g-null-null&eid=fkhvzv-m8hvo4qk-5g&loid=AQHfsWOmd4L8MQAAAZW1jqmLhTpqGhbxFS3rJQsWwSvnivjfdavOFVwyCIls-tqIdmImAOukifJkXtlRLhSmADksbCRcP9eN-MeXWmz1k8GxPvh3GjrpPNaFTXLe89at Help: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?lang=en&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Aemail_email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01%3BF%2BCP1kDPTHKzI%2BQsRXyDeA%3D%3D&midToken=AQEagltKN1Gz4Q&midSig=1RkDFRAHm49bI1&trk=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-help-0-textfooterglimmer&trkEmail=eml-email_editorial_suggested_top_conversations_01-help-0-textfooterglimmer-null-fkhvzv~m8hvo4qk~5g-null-null&eid=fkhvzv-m8hvo4qk-5g&otpToken=MWIwMTFmZTQxMzI3Y2NjM2JkMjQwNGVkNDIxY2UyYjQ4OGM5ZDg0MTljYWY4YzYxNzljMjAwNjk0YzU5NWFmYWZmZDRkZjgzNTJlYWNjZDgwZWIzYTkwY2ZhOGY2OTA1YWE2NTllNDUxMWY4Y2JjYzg1M2Y4MSwxLDE%3D © 2025 LinkedIn Corporation, 1zwnj000 West Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085.

If it is, return the result in the exact format specified. Otherwise, return 'Not a job application email'. The company is Roblox, and the job position is Senior Software Engineer. The status can be'received', 'interviewing','rejected', or 'job offer'. \n","\n","First, I need to analyze the provided email. The sender is Glassdoor, and the subject is about Roblox's employee reviews and updates. The body contains mentions of Roblox's features, some job positions, and discussions about applying for roles like Senior Software Engineer, Product Manager, etc. \n","\n","The user mentioned that they sent a job application to Roblox for a Senior Software Engineer position. Now, they're receiving an email from Glassdoor about Roblox's updates and employee reviews. \n","\n","I need to determine if this is a response to their job application. Since the email is from Glassdoor, which is a job site, and it's about Roblox's internal updates, it's likely not a response to their job application. Glassdoor often sends such emails to their users to keep them updated, not as a job offer or rejection. \n","\n","Moreover, the email includes job listings for Roblox, which suggests it's about applying for those positions, not responding to a previous application. \n","\n","Therefore, this email is not a response to the user's job application to Roblox. It's more of an internal update from Glassdoor about Roblox's activities and job postings. \n","\n","So, the result should be 'Not a job application email'.\n","</think>\n","\n","Not a job application email\n","Extracted Output: Not a job application email\n","Extracted Data (this email): None\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Email 9:\n","Sender: Blink Fitness <no-reply@blinkfitness.com>\n","Subject: Andrew, your 1-day free trial pass at Blink Fitness is now active!\n","Body: This pass is valid for: One workout at Blink Fitness through 04/04/2025.

The company I applied to was Blink Fitness, and the position was probably something like a fitness instructor or a part-time employee. \n","\n","Looking at the email, the subject is about a free trial pass, which is definitely not related to a job application. The body of the email is promoting a fitness pass, offering details about how to redeem it, including things like bringing photo ID, water bottle, towel, and locker. It also mentions having vending machines with items like headphones and deodorant. \n","\n","This seems like a promotional email from Blink Fitness, not a response to a job application. The email is trying to encourage people to use their fitness pass, not to apply for a job. There's no mention of job positions, application processes, or any job-related information. \n","\n","So, since this email is about a fitness pass and not a job application, it doesn't fit the criteria.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is an Equal Opportunity Employer, including Disability/Veterans.\n","Full Response: Okay, so I need to analyze this email to determine if it's a response to a job application I sent to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The instructions say that if it's a response, I should return the company, job position, and status in a specific format. The status can be'received', 'interviewing','rejected', or 'job offer'. If it's not a job application response, I should say 'Not a job application email'. Also, I shouldn't include any extra explanations, just the exact format.\n","\n","First, let me look at the sender. It's JPMorgan Chase & Co. Human Resources. That's a company known for having various job positions, so the company is definitely JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n","\n","The subject line is \"Take action to confirm your identity\". That seems like a request for a verification code, probably related to their careers site. The body of the email is addressed to Andrew, telling him to use a code to confirm his identity on their careers site. It also mentions that the code will expire in 10 minutes and provides a link to send a new code. \n","\n","The email is from an unmonitored email box, so it's automatically generated. It also includes a link to their careers page and mentions that they're an equal opportunity employer. \n","\n","Now, considering the context, this seems like a follow-up after someone applied for a job. Typically, after an application is received, companies might send verification codes to confirm the candidate's identity. So, this could be a response to a job application. \n","\n","But I need to determine the status. The options are'received', 'interviewing','rejected', or 'job offer'. The email is asking the recipient to take an action, which is using a code. This is more of a confirmation step rather than an offer. So, it's not a job offer yet. It's also not rejecting the application because it's asking for further action. \n","\n","So, the status here is likely'received' because the company is responding to the application by asking for confirmation. They haven't rejected it, and it's not an offer yet. \n","\n","I should make sure that this isn't a job offer. The email doesn't state that the recipient has been hired or is offering a position. It's just a verification step. So, it's not a job offer. \n","\n","Also, the email is about their careers site, so it's definitely related to a job application. Therefore, the classification is that it's a response to a job application. \n","\n","So, putting it all together, the company is JPMorgan Chase & Co., the job position isn't specified in the email, so I can leave that as [position] as a placeholder. The status is'received'. \n","\n","Wait, the job position isn't mentioned here. The email doesn't specify which position the recipient is applying for. So, I can't determine the exact position. But the instructions say to include the job position as [position], so I can leave it as is. \n","\n","Therefore, the response should be: 'Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co., Job Position: [position], Status: received'. \n","\n","I think that's correct. It's a response to a job application, the company is JPMorgan Chase & Co., the position isn't specified, and the status is'received' because they're confirming the application with a verification code.\n","</think>\n","\n","Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co., Job Position: [position], Status: received\n","Extracted Output: Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co., Job Position: [position], Status: received\n","Extracted Data (this email): {'Company': 'JPMorgan Chase & Co.', 'Job Position': '[position]', 'Status': 'received'}\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Email 11:\n","Sender: \"JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Even though this is just an automated confirmation email, you should know that we’re truly excited you want to join the band. We’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

It mentions excitement about the candidate joining, which is a positive sign. It also mentions that they'll get back to the candidate as soon as possible, which is standard in job responses.

This is typical of a company trying to engage candidates before making a decision.\n","\n","The subject and body are both tailored to the individual, which is a key indicator that this is a response to a specific job application.

These have spanned a series of news that’s been hard to watch, including: Presented by Hey Snackers, We’re among those who are eagerly awaiting tonight’s season finale of “Severance” on Apple TV+, but apparently not enough Outies are watching the streaming service or its big-ticket gambles : new (macro)data shows that the company is losing over $1 billion a year on it, making it the only money-loser among Apple’s otherwise lucrative Services business . The S&P 500 dipped 0.2%, the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.3%, and the Russell 2000 gave back 0.6% on Thursday. Utilities, energy, financials, and healthcare were the S&P 500 sector ETFs that gained on the day; tech, materials, and industrials led the way down. And it was nice to see Nvidia rally, but less nice to see the stock suffer from its first “dark cross” since 2022 . Let’s get down to quizness — test your knowledge of recent newsletters with our Snacks Seven Quiz : Every time Tesla declines $2.43, how much money does CEO Elon Musk personally lose? Check your answer. CATHODE Tesla needs a big win to break out of a slump. Is this it? No bones about it, it’s been a rough stretch for Tesla. As of yesterday, shares of the Elon Musk-led auto company were down 17.1% over the past 12 trading days. These have spanned a series of news that’s been hard to watch, including: Selling by Tesla insiders ; Analysts cutting delivery targets ; Early-year sales figures disappointing ; Progress by rivals on autonomous driving ; Competitors also making leaps on EV charging ; And, perhaps most worrisome, deteriorating public perception of the brand. Then, yesterday saw the announcement that Tesla would be recalling over 46,000 Cybertrucks . It’s bad, and bad enough that small-fry rival electric vehicle makers like Lucid and Polestar are shamelessly circling the ailing company and hoping to vulture some customers , with Lucid offering a $4,000 trade-in discount for Tesla owners buying the Lucid Air and Polestar offering $5,000 off leases for Tesla owners. Caught in the crossfire are retail investors, who’ve been getting smoked over the past several days by buying the dip in the hopes of a stock price jump that’s proved elusive. This has been pretty painful; JPMorgan estimated that retail investors’ performance is down 7% year-to-date, double that of the S&P 500. Rough stuff. It’s simple enough: Tesla needs a win, and badly. With yesterday’s session pretty much flat for Tesla, one report that the carmaker plans to introduce a coveted new piece of battery tech into the Cybertruck could’ve come as some crucially positive news. Your standard battery is made with expensive, toxic wet solvents and large drying ovens. “Dry cathodes” are seen by the industry as a pivotal innovation that can bring down the cost of batteries significantly, a production change that Tesla itself said could save it $1 billion a year in manufacturing costs. THE TAKEAWAY The dry electrode technology introduced by Tesla in 2022 prompted an industry sprint into the new battery tech, but pulling off the production of a dry cathode at scale has been challenging. If Tesla pulls it off, well, maybe that sales slump isn’t that big of a worry . Presented by Mode Mobile The $20B deal between Apple and Google that should concern all iPhone users... Google paid Apple $20B in 2022 to be the default search engine on iPhones — and both companies hoped to shield it from the public. The deal continues to fuel Google’s ad revenue engine, which made an eye-popping +$250B in 2024. Mode Mobile wants smartphone users to get their piece of that money. They’re flipping the data industry on its head, splitting the profits with their users by turning smartphones into an income-generating asset . Here’s what that looks like: Paid over $325M to over 45M users. Generated 32,481% 3-year revenue growth from 2019 to 2022. Ranked #1 fastest-growing software company by Deloitte in 2023. 1 📲 Their EarnPhone could be considered the Uber of smartphones, and they’re gearing up for a potential IPO on the Nasdaq (ticker: $MODE ). 2 And as tech companies desperately seek to extract more data, you can invest in Mode’s pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share. 3 Invest in Mode and receive your stake in the $1T smartphone industry. 4 TOKEN GESTURES Meet the most expensive AI ever Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what’s the most expensive AI model of them all? No, this isn’t a line from the new live-action “Snow White” movie, but if it were, the mirror would have to answer “ OpenAI’s o1-pro .” The new model uses an insane amount of computing power to employ multistep reasoning to better answer prompts. This model isn’t meant for mere mortals like you and I, but aims its sights on giant corporate accounts, companies that would hook up their services and operations to an API for a model like this. That’s where the money is — and where the costs add up. How the AI “charges” for use is via a measure called tokens. A small job could cost just a few tokens, while asking it to analyze a 1,300-page book could take 1 million tokens. And it costs more for an output of that size than the input. For instance, DeepSeek’s Reasoner model costs $0.55 per a million-token input, and $2.19 for a million-token output. Our table shows just how much more expensive OpenAI’s new model is. THE TAKEAWAY Pricing is a huge issue for OpenAI as it struggles to find a viable business model to cover the enormous costs of running these services — CEO Sam Altman recently confirmed the company is losing money on ChatGPT Pro. The company’s recent pivot to release only “reasoning” models like o1-pro going forward also means much higher computing costs. For instance, it cost OpenAI’s o3 model $3,400 to solve one hard puzzle . Last year, OpenAI reportedly lost about $5 billion after bringing in only $3.7 billion in revenue. It doesn’t take the most expensive AI ever to figure out those numbers don’t equal a successful business.

The email is from Anytime Fitness, so the company is clear. The subject line says \"Don't forget to take advantage of your free workout!\" which is a promotional message. The body is inviting someone to visit the gym, schedule a tour, or call for a free pass. \n","\n","The user mentioned that this email is a response to a job application. But wait, Anytime Fitness doesn't typically offer job positions; they're a fitness center. So, this email is more about promoting their services, not about hiring someone. \n","\n","Also, the note says that if the email is from Glassdoor or LinkedIn about job postings, it's not a job application response.

The company mentioned in the email is Google Cloud, and the position is NEXT 25. The status should be either received, interviewing, rejected, or job offer.\n","\n","First, the email is from Kaggle, which is a company that's part of Google Cloud. The subject line says \"Join Kaggle at Google Cloud NEXT 25!\" which immediately tells me it's about a conference or event. The body of the email is promoting a conference happening in Las Vegas from April 9-11, 2025. They're inviting Andrew M. Dragoslavic and offering a discount code for the ticket.

We place a great emphasis on matching a candidate's background and interests with available opportunities and are continually impressed by the caliber of today's candidates. While we regret to inform you that you were not selected for the position below, we will retain your resume in our database. 2025 Entry Level Software Engineer, 109345BR We encourage you to:Log into your candidate portal to check on that status of any other positions you applied to Browse our open positions as they become availableJoin our Talent Community to receive job recommendations and stay up to date on career-related newsWe appreciate your interest in BAE Systems and we wish you success in your professional endeavors. Thank you,BAE Systems Talent Acquisition Team\n","Full Response: Okay, so I need to analyze this email to determine if it's a response to a job application I sent to BAE Systems. The email is from \"AutomationManager@brassring.com\" with the subject mentioning BAE Systems and an application status for a 2025 Entry Level Software Engineer position. The body starts with a thank you, then informs the recipient that they weren't selected for the position, retains the resume, and provides instructions to log into a candidate portal, browse open positions, and join a talent community. \n","\n","First, the sender is an automation manager, which might be a role within the company, but the email is directed towards a specific job position. The subject clearly refers to a job application status, so it's likely a response to my application. The body mentions the position title, the reference number, and provides action items, which are typical in job rejection emails. It also includes a call to action to check the candidate portal, which is a standard follow-up after an application is rejected. \n","\n","Since the email is structured to inform the recipient about the rejection and provide further engagement opportunities, it fits the criteria of a job application response. The company is BAE Systems, the position is Entry Level Software Engineer, and the status is'rejected' because the recipient was not selected. There's no mention of job offers, so it's not 'job offer'. \n","\n","I should make sure that this isn't a Glassdoor or LinkedIn job posting. The subject and body don't mention any job openings; instead, they're about the status of an application. Therefore, it's a proper response to my job application. \n","\n","So, the result should be: Company: BAE Systems, Job Position: 2025 Entry Level Software Engineer, Status: rejected.\n","</think>\n","\n","Company: BAE Systems, Job Position: 2025 Entry Level Software Engineer, Status: rejected\n","Extracted Output: Company: BAE Systems, Job Position: 2025 Entry Level Software Engineer, Status: rejected\n","Extracted Data (this email): {'Company': 'BAE Systems', 'Job Position': '2025 Entry Level Software Engineer', 'Status': 'rejected'}\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Email 25:\n","Sender: ErieInsurancejobnotification@noreply.jobs2web.com\n","Subject: New jobs posted from Erie Insurance\n","Body: The following jobs matched your search agent at Erie Insurance and can be found at jobs.erieinsurance.com .
